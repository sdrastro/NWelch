Installation
------------

There is an experimental version of an NWelch package available 
from TestPyPI. Install with

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ NWelch

If the pip installation doesn't work for you, the next-best
thing is to clone the GitHub repository and place the source
code somewhere in your python path.
